            <h1>Interests</h1>
            
            <h4>Computer Science</h4>
            <p>This term comprises wide range of topics that are somehow related to information technologies, computers and Internet from surfing the world web through different operating systems to creating own software. These things are on the edge of the sword in nowadays being. I see it is highly amusing to play with the digital ocean of simplifications and possibilities. In particular, I am curious with web development, a confident cloud services user and a fan of Microsoft technologies.</p>
            
            <h4>Entrepreneurship</h4>
            <p>European classic literature brought me up that way I could not ever endure any inappropriate, on my opinion, guidance or restrictions. Across the time I realized that the philosophy of being an entrepreneur in my life is the way I should go. Currently, I believe it may lead me, help me carry lots of my ideas through and make the man inside me.</p>            
            
            <h4>Self-management</h4>
            <p> As I go further along my life line I see it’s getting more and more complex. There are constantly appearing new psychological issues that might stop my personal development or slow it down. To avoid such a pitfalls I always learn more and do researches how to overcome anxieties and failures, how to be more productive and successful in exceedingly concurrent world.</p>
            
            <h4>English</h4>
            <p>Notwithstanding that my native speaking language is Ukrainian, I am in love with English. It’s simple and it gives you a chance to communicate globally. From here, you can feel yourself as a part of a globe, but not only as a part of the country you have grown in. Besides, all kinds of new things are emerged in English. That’s a great opportunity.</p>
            
            <h4>Finances</h4>
            <p>To win a money pot you should know the rules of the game everyone plays around, right? I deem, a man has to discover what the money is, how they work and how to earn them. And I find it really interesting to learn how to play the economic game.</p>
            
            <h4>And much more</h4>
            <p>I have pointed out just a few of my interests here that take most of my time. However, there are much more things I am interested in. Literature, games, sports, music, movies, biology, physics, Universe, adventures, relationships and much, much more. I am so sorry, there is too little time to learn all the beauty the world offers us.</p>
