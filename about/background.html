            <h1>Background</h1>
            <p>
                I was born 17th February 1994 in an ordinary family. I had already accustomed to work and study before going to school because my father was a joiner and mother was a teacher.
            </p>
            <p>
                I went to school in 2000. I was the shiest one in the entire school. This feature helped me to stay studious and successful along all the school years. There, in school, I loved about every single subject from math to history.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sport was one of the most beloved activities for me. I stood in school basketball club for several years. I liked play volleyball either and, surely, I adored playing football. I took part in a few basketball and football tournaments.
            </p>
            <p>
                I got my first PC when I was thirteen. I played many games in my free time what made me quite familiar with the computer. At the middle of my study in school I felt I would like to become an interpreter. Albeit, in a few years before ending school I chose to devote my life to programming. Since that time I started to learn HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript and jQuery. Hence, I have been known with all of that before entering university. In 2012 I accomplished school being among best students.
            </p>
            <p>
                That year I have entered computer science faculty of national pedagogical university in Kyiv. Yeah, it doesn’t sound like something technical. However, it’s given me basic programming and math knowledge, taught me some psychology and also allowed me to develop by myself.
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, on the first year I have bought a C#/.NET book and started to read it. It consisted of fifteen hundred pages of difficult and new material as for my young perception. So on the first study course I managed to read only three hundred of it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The next summer I had been reading Head First C# book and doing all the exercises incorporated there. So that to the middle of the summer I had coded my first compiled animated application. After accomplishing that book I read another one called Code Complete by Steve McConnell. It was a technological tail for me.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the second year I had been already aware how to write simple apps with C# and .NET. Nevertheless, I’d been forced to learn Delphi language at university. It was awfully boring, but it gave me another view on programming algorithms.
            </p>
            <p>
                The next winter I dared to read all of those fifteen hundred pages by Andrew Troelsen about C# and .NET. And I succeeded. I had gotten some realization of what is Entity Framework, WCF, WPF and ASP.NET.
            </p>
            <p>
                The further step came in summer when I decided to practice in ASP.NET. Firstly, I developed a pair of blogs for myself. But I wanted something more, so that I came up Find With Whom. I had been coding that website for a month and deployed it to a real server in October. It was my achievement, however I didn’t pay attention for that project for a while because of the need to study in university.
            </p>
            <p>
                There was the winter again and I was reading another .NET book. This time it’s about WPF. Starting from this one I began to read books in English. WPF is quite complex API, but I felt pleasure reading it. After reading the book I created a desktop application for my lovely girl to allow her always to feel my presence.
            </p>
            <p>
                As you can see, all the works I were interested in happened during my holidays either in winter or in summer. Studying in university is exhaustive enough.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, the next summer, before my forth course in university, I started working on serkalayder.github.io. But I interrupted it because of willing to learn other languages. So I learned Java a bit and then read a few books about Ruby, Rails and Agile. This helped me to join an internship in a web studio. I had learnt more necessary info about web development with Ruby.
            </p>
            <p>
                During my internship I created a software development study group within my university. There I try to teach students of how software are created and what peculiarities this process has nowadays.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I am working on the update with my site serkalayder.github.io
