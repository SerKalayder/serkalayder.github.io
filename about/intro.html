            <h1>Intro</h1>
            <p>Hello, stranger. My name is Sergiy. I am twenty-two years old at the moment of writing this. I was lucky to be born near Kyiv in Ukraine. My daily life spins around computer science and self-development. I enthusiastically endeavor to be successful with that.  </p>
            <p>Welcome to the digital representation of my little cozy world. This is the hub that I maintain mainly for myself for everything somehow associated to me. Here I am trying to structure and streamline my experience and to share some other points of mine with the big world. Here you may find many info about me, my interests, thoughts, activities and works.</p> 
            <p>The circle of questions to be addressed here comprises entrepreneurship, information technologies and software development, finances, marketing, personality development, productivity and leadership. If there’s necessity to communicate with me, find the contacts on the main page. Have a hope, some writings accumulated here by me either may help you resolve problems you are concerned with.</p>
