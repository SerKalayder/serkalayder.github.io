            <h2>How should I choose what to do right at the moment?</h2>

            <p>If you are reading this, you obviously know the mechanisms of twenty first century world and you are drowning. Any spaces are opened to you with merely a click. You’ve got infinite amount of opportunities embracing you. Every piece of knowledge you pick up may be absorbed by your flexible mind.</p> 
            <p>Reading books that make you potent, practicing your skills the books and days suggest you now, listening and watching educational audios and videos, sports, playing games, watching movies, listening to music, learning languages, writing, association, creating new things and so on. But then slam! And you are a child sitting down on your knees, stunned by a heap of new toys, and trying to opt one out. You can’t. </p>

            <h5>Which one?</h5>

            <p>While you are a child, you normally don’t have an aim of your life. This is what makes difference between a child and a grown man. Then the answer is simple: </p>
            <p class="important">at this current moment do what is the most necessary right now to make the longest move in reaching your life’s goal</p> 
            <p>If you have a goal of the entire life, if you have such a dream, you likely value it even more you do your own life. When there was a huge truck moving just on you or whether it’s a meteorite falling straight down your head, you wouldn’t be thinking about a cup of ice tea because it’s hot outside, you wouldn’t be deciding to bend down to tie your shoelaces. And you would not be lingering then. </p>
            <p>In the moment you realize you are going to meet your death, in a few decades of milliseconds you grab the solution floating in your mind and run away from the imminence.      </p>
            <p>That’s how you saved your life. And that’s how you should opt your toy out from the heap. This is the way you move to the goal. Now choose the prime step that leads you toward your aim and accomplish it as best as you can.</p>
